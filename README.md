# JC Crud example!

The purpose of this project is to consume a containerized application containing the busineess logic for the CRUD Operations on system users inside the JC environment.

# What is included in this project?

Because the main tech stack was vuejs and their perks, in order to simulate a very similar stack, we'll be using:


- React 18 using Typescript
- React Router
- React Query
- Redux Toolkit
- React Query + Reduc Toolkit integration
- TailwindCss
- Vite
- JSDoc for the documentation and its TS plugin
- setup Unit testing and Coverage
- Server Side Rendering with Server Side fetching for the first run.
- Containerization (Docker) so it can be exported to the artifact registry and use everywhere

# Requirements

## For production
- Docker, for install instructions take a look [here](https://www.docker.com/)

## For development

- Checkout the development branch (SSR is not enabled there) so you can take advantage of vite and hot realoading
- Nodejs 18+  and npm installed,  you can take a look at [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [NVM for windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
